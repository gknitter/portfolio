      <h1>Secretary of Conference Coordination Handbook</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class = "overview">Conference Coordination is an essential role in the secretariat; imagine hosting MUNUM without any university spaces. CC is in charge of the room reservations, set-ups, and any other reservations relevant to the conference. CC is the liaison between the facilities we use (Rackham Graduate School, the League, Palmer Commons, Power Center, East Quad) and the rest of staff/the conference. It is one of the more continuously involved roles throughout the year. Additionally, CC orders staff related resources (folders, pads, gavels, etc). </p>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p class = "purpose">With a well functioning Secretary of Conference Coordination, MUNUM should flow pretty well. Your biggest goal is to keep close contact with the buildings and ensure that rooms function for their needs. Directors and delegates should be happy with your work (while having little idea that it happened) and it should be easy to move between locations. Donâ€™t drop a room in the middle of the conference and you should be pretty successful. </p>
      <h2>Characteristics of the Role</h2>
      <p class = "characteristics">Some things that you will quickly learn and develop in this position:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Busy</li>
          <li>Engaged</li>
          <li>Knowledgeable</li>
          <li>Communicative</li>
          <li>Rewarding</li>
      </ul>
